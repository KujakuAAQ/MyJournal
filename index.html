You can read journal entries related to my job here - <a href="Product Management.html">Life of a Product Manager</a> Or view my resume here - <a href="https://www.angelineelise.com/">My Product Manager Profile</a>. This blog is my personal digital journal. My beautiful dalmatian is my companion and features in all my adventures.
